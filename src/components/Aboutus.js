            <h1>Our History</h1>
            <p>In the early 2000s, a group of passionate globetrotters came together with a common dream: to make the world a smaller place, one adventure at a time. They envisioned a platform that would not only help people plan their trips but also ignite a spark of curiosity, fostering a sense of wonder for the world beyond one's doorstep. Thus, "travelUs" was born.</p>
            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>We are dedicated to inspiring individuals to embark on enriching journeys that expand horizons, deepen cultural understanding, and create lifelong memories. We aim to be your trusted source of travel inspiration, providing you with expert advice, curated itineraries, and insider tips to help you make the most of your adventures.</p>
            <h1>Our Vision</h1>
